Neural Operators and Operator Networks vs Parametric Approach

:red_circle: **Please note that we didn't spend much time in doing the cross-validation and tuning the hyperparameters. The performance of the model can be further improved. And the comparision between these operator learning models may be different after carefully tuning.**

## Heat Diffusion
### Problem Description

In this experiment, we discussed the two-dimensional parametric heat equation:
$$u_t=\Delta u, t \in[0,T],\ (x_1,x_2)\in[-1,1]^2,\mu\in[-1,1]^d$$
with the initial condition 



speed of propagation $c=0.1$. **The objective is to approximate the operator**  $\cal{G}^\dagger:f\rightarrow$ $u(\cdot, T=5)$

### Results

![diffusion](figure/Diffusion_compare.png)

- The dataset was generated with $d=6$ with resolution $64 \times 64$.
- For FNO and CNO, we used the same dataset with 150 training points and 50 test points.
- The training epoch for FNO is 100 but 1000 for CNO.
- The average error of FNO and CNO on test dataset is 2.8752 and 3.6586, respectively.



Further more, we test the resolution invariance of FNO for different $d$. Similarly, we only use 150 training data to train the model. 50 data to test the model. We train the model on the resolution $64\times 64$ and test it performance in different resolution. **Note, due to the longer training process, we didn't test the resolution invariance of CNO**

| resolution\d | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      | 6      |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 32           | 2.6700 | 4.4333 | 4.5112 | 4.7639 | 4.7230 | 4.6837 |
| 64           | 1.9867 | 2.4443 | 2.6045 | 2.8313 | 2.9434 | 2.8752 |
| 96           | 1.9704 | 2.5296 | 2.6708 | 2.7527 | 2.9380 | 2.9412 |
| 128          | 1.9254 | 2.6723 | 2.8095 | 2.9824 | 3.0626 | 3.1439 |

- We show figure of the resolution invariance for $d=6$.

- It can be imagined that the effect of alising will become serious with increasing $d$ã€‚
- In this problem, we didn't see the distinguished alising effect. We believed it may be a very easy task.

## Wave equation

### Problem Description

In this experiment, we discussed the a prototypical *linear hyperbolic PDE*, given as follows:
$$u_tt-c^2\Delta u=0,\ \text{in}\ D\times(0,T), u_0(x,y)=f(x,y)$$
If the initial condition has following forms:

$$f(x,y)=\frac{\pi}{K^2}\sum^K_{i,j=1}a_{ij}\cdot(i^2+j^2)^{-r}\sin(\pi ix)\sin(\pi jy)$$

With $K=24$ and $r=1$. The exact solution at time $t>0$ is given by

$$u(x,y,t)=\frac{\pi}{K^2}\sum^K_{i,j=1}a_{ij}\cdot(i^2+j^2)^{-r}\sin(\pi ix)\sin(\pi jy)\cos(c\pi t\sqrt{i^2+j^2}),\ \forall(x,y)\in D$$

speed of propagation $c=0.1$. **The objective is to approximate the operator**  $\cal{G}^\dagger:f\rightarrow$ $u(\cdot, T=5)$

### Results

![wave_compare](figure/wave_compare.png)

- 512 training dataset and 128 test dataset. Trained on the resolution with $64\times 64$. The test error of FNO on 128 test dataset is 8.0658 (~ 500 epochs). The error of CNO on 128 test dataset is 11.7288 (~ 400 epochs).



# Conclusions

- At least, we found that the CNO is not as easy to train as FNO. Often, we need more training epoches and careful tuning to achive the same performance.

## Q&A

1. Unable to run the GPU of the CNO on the cluster. `Ninja is required to load C++ extensions in Pycharm`
